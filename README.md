# Migrants

Migrants is a small toy project I wrote to display where your Facebook friends
are from and where they presently live.

## Update 2015-06-21

Retiring this project, as of
[Facebook API v2.0](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog#v2_0) it
is no longer possible to retrieve information about users who have not installed
an app through the `/me/friends` endpoint, which is fundamental to this.
